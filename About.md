This project involves conducting an A/B test to assess the effectiveness of a new banner on an online retail store website.
The banner is designed to promote a new section within the store, and it is imperative to gauge its efficiency before implementing it for all users.
The project has been structured into distinct phases, utilizing various tools:

(1) Data Cleansing: Employed SQL queries to cleanse the data, ensuring its accuracy and relevance for analysis.
(2) Statistical Analysis: Utilized Excel for statistical analysis to evaluate the performance metrics derived from the A/B test.
(3) Visualization of Metrics: Leveraged Tableau for visually representing business metrics and conveying conclusions drawn from the statistical analysis.
(4) Reporting: Prepared a comprehensive written report detailing the entire process, methodologies, statistical findings, and their implications. Additionally, a succinct summary presentation encapsulating the key highlights and outcomes of the project was created.

Throughout these stages, meticulous attention was paid to maintaining data integrity and employing sound analytical techniques to derive meaningful insights.
The focus remained on accurately assessing the impact of the new banner on user engagement and conversion rates.
